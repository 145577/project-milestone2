fashion recommendation system 

Fashion recommendation systems have become essential in the e-commerce industry, enabling personalized shopping experiences by suggesting products tailored to individual tastes. This project presents a machine learning-based fashion recommendation system that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze and recommend clothing items based on visual similarity. CNNs, known for their efficacy in image recognition tasks, enable the system to capture complex patterns in clothing images, such as texture, color, and style. Our approach involves pre-processing a dataset of fashion images, training a CNN model to extract feature embeddings, and implementing a recommendation algorithm that suggests visually similar items. Experimental results demonstrate that our system provides accurate and relevant recommendations, highlighting the potential of CNNs in enhancing the user experience in fashion retail. This report details the model architecture, training process, evaluation methods, and the overall impact of the system on personalized fashion recommendations.
